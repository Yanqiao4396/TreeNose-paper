\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, you should relate your results to each of your research
questions, one by one.

Any more anecdotal observations, or anything you observed in the course of
answering your research questions that you did not deliberately set out to
investigate should be included in a subsection at the end of this section,
called ``Discussion''.
