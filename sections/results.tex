\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present the results of our evaluation. To avoid redundancy, we combined the evaluation data of the RQ2 and the RQ3 into a single table.


Table~\ref{tab:annotation_table} shows the confusion matrixes of \texttt{TreeNose} and the other tools in the annotation study. TN represents \texttt{TreeNose}, and OD represents the other tools.
On the average, \texttt{TreeNose} significantly outperformed the other tools in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
With the 0.94 F1 score, we conclude that \texttt{TreeNose} achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting the code smells.
When there is no value in the table, it means it's not possible to calculate the recall. For example, 
\texttt{TreeNose} flagged all the positive when we selected samples from the \texttt{TreeNose} detection. Therefore, it's not
possible to calculate the recall or the F1 score of \texttt{TreeNose} in this environment. The same applies to the OD-selected samples.
Another interesting observation is that the OD group achieves 1.0 precision in the \texttt{TreeNose}-selected samples, but the recall is down to 0.32,
which results in a low F1 score of 0.48. This indicates that the OD group is not able to detect all the code smells in the \texttt{TreeNose}-selected samples.

Table~\ref{tab:percentage_table} discloses the percentage of the code smells in each programming language system. Looking at the table, we can see Complex Conditional (CC)
counts for almost 1/3 of the code smells in each system, indicating that it is the most common code smell across programming languages. 
Long Class (LC) and Long Method (LM) behave differently in the Java and JavaScript systems. In the Java system,
LC occurs 30 times more than LM, while in the JavaScript system it's the opposite, LM occurs 10 times more than LC. This indicates that the programming languages
have different tendencies in terms of code smells.

Table~\ref{tab:occurrence_table} shows the occurrence discrepancy scores of the code smells in the systems. It indicates that no programming language outperforms the others in every code smell,
meaning that each programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of code smells. For example, Java has the highest score in the LM (Long Method) code smell,
 while Python has the highest score in the LMC (Long Message Chain) code smell. We also learned that certain code smells significantly vary in occurrence across programming languages.
 Especially, Java performs 3 times worse than the other programming languages in the LC (Long Class) code smell. 
 This is aligned with the result from Table~\ref{tab:percentage_table}., where we observed that the LC code smell is the most common code smell in the Java system.
