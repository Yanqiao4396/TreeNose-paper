A code smell is a code-design issue that can lead to decrease
in code quality, thereby hindering developers from reading or maintaining
a software program. Code smell detection tools help developers by
automatically checking the existence of code smells. Code smell detection
tools have the potential to be language-independent, because common code
smells occur in many different programming languages.
A language-independent code smell detector can set unified detection rules
across programming languages, which is especially useful in multi-language
software development. However, few code smell detection tools support multiple
programming languages. To fill the aforementioned gap, this paper presents a
tool, called \texttt{TreeNose}, for detecting code smells across programming languages.
\texttt{TreeNose} can detect 5 types of code smells across multiple languages
(i.e., Python, Java, and JavaScript) and its extensible design enables it
to support additional languages. This paper answers three research questions
to explore the quality of \texttt{TreeNose} and structural patterns of code smells
in different languages. In order to answer those questions, we evaluated
\texttt{TreeNose} on 16 open-source projects implemented
in the three chosen programming languages and the combinations of those languages, comparing
its results to those arising from the use of traditional language-specific
code smell detectors in an manual annotation study. 
As a result, \texttt{TreeNose} has a
F1 score of 0.94 for the selected code smells in the chosen systems.
The experimental results also revealed that Complex Conditional code smell counts for a significant amount
in all language systems with high percentages from 32\% to 51\%. 
It also showed that Long Method code smell with 38\% is common in JavaScript, and Long Class code smell with 30\% is common in Java.
Finally, the results showed that every single-language system has certain code smells 100\% more common than the other languages,
which indicates that programming languages have strong tendencies to have specific code smells.
