% Always edit your text without the use of word-wrap, like the paragraphs in
% this section, because:
%
% 1. Hard-breaks make it easier to track changes in version control.
% 2. It is easier to insert comments explaining some aspect of your writing
%    mid-sentence
% 3. You can break up the structure of your sentence across multiple lines so
%    that it is easier to edit later.

% If you are having trouble structuring or phrasing your text, try summarising

Code smells are a series of code-design-related defects. They decrease
readability \cite{5741260} and maintainability \cite{6392174} \cite{6405287} of software projects,
which block the potential for the future maintenance \cite{Fowler_Beck}. Due to the negative impact of code smells on software projects,
developers acknowledge the importance of detecting them. The manual detection in
software projects is is an error-prone and resource-consuming process \cite{DetectingDefectsInObject}. 
Therefore, code smell detection tools have been developed to automate this process.
Different code smell detection tools rely on various detection strategies,
such as abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis, Machine Learning, and Static Analysis.
Popular code smell detection tools, PMD \cite{PMD} and CheckStyle \cite{CheckStyle} for example,
become one step of continuous integration in open-source software projects like Apache Commons Lang \cite{ApacheCommonsLang} and Jenkins \cite{Jekins}.

One of the characteristics of modern software projects is the use of multiple programming languages \cite{723183}. The combinations of
programming languages allow developers to rely on functionalities and libraries that are not available in a single programming language.
However, the complexity of multi-language software projects increases the difficulty of project comprehension and maintenance \cite{7476675, 10.1109/SCAM.2012.11, 7396422}.
Along with the complexity, the multi-language software projects also introduce the challenge of code smell detection. 
The existing code smell detection tools are designed to detect code smells in a single programming language. Therefore, developers have to configure multiple 
code smell detection tools in multi-language software projects \cite{Jekins}.

While few code smell detection tools are language-independent, most code smells are. For example, the Long Method, one of the most prevalent code smells \cite{developersCare}, can exist in tons of programming languages.
Due to the language-independence of code smells, code smell detection tools also have the potential to be language-independent.
Van Emden and Moonen, the builders of the first code smell detection tool, indicated that their detection
approach in Java has the potential to be applied to other programming languages in the future \cite{1173068}.
Abidi Et al. built a language-independent design smells (i.e., anti-patterns and code smells) detection tool to detect 15 multi-language-specific
design smells in Java and C/C++ \cite{MultiLanguageCodeSmells} \cite{Fault-Prone}. A language-independent code smell detection tool can
provide a unified detection experience for multi-language software projects. It can also avoid the overhead 
of configuring multiple code smell detection tools with various detection approaches.

This paper present a language-independent code smell detection tool, named \texttt{TreeNose}, to detect 5 types of code smells, Complex Conditional, 
Long Class, Long Method, Long Message Chain, Long Parameter List, across multiple programming languages.
\texttt{TreeNose} implements TreeSitter \cite{treeSitter}, a general parser generator,
to parse the source code of multiple programming languages into the nodes of AST. On top of AST, \texttt{TreeNose} queries the nodes with detection rules to detect targeted code smells with thresholds, which are configured by developers.
\texttt{TreeNose} is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to add programming languages without rewriting source code.
  
To evaluate the accuracy of \texttt{TreeNose},we evaluated \texttt{TreeNose} on 9 open-source projects
implemented in Java, JavaScript, or Python. We compared the performance of \texttt{TreeNose} with the combination of 3 language-specific code smell detection tools 
in a manual annotation study.
We also conducted evaluations on the characteristics 
of code smells in different programming languages. 

The key contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A language-independent code smell detecter that detects 5 types of code smells across programming languages.
    \item An evaluation of \texttt{TreeNose} to evaluate its accuracy in detecting code smells in multiple programming languages.
    \item An experiment to reveal the prevalence and distribution of code smells in different programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

Our results show that \texttt{TreeNose} achieved high precision of 92\% and F1 score of 0.94 in detecting selected code smells in target programming languages.
We also found (1) Complex Conditional counts for 42\% of the total code smells detected on average, which is the most common code smell in the programming languages we evaluated.
(2) Programming languages have strong tendencies to have specific code smells, such as JavaScript contains 3 times more Long Method than other systems.
(3) Multi-Language software projects have less tendencies in code smells than single-language software projects.
