\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}

In this paper, we presented \texttt{TreeNose}, a language-independent code smell detection tool.
\texttt{TreeNose} uses TreeSitter AST to detect code smells without the need for language-specific rules.
\texttt{TreeNose} can detect 5 code smells: Complex Conditional (CC), Long Class (LC), Long Method (LM), Long Method Chain (LMC), and Long Parameter List (LPL).
We evaluated \texttt{TreeNose} with an annotation study in three programming language system, i.e., Java, JavaScript, and Python,
and compared it with other language-specific tools in a set of high-quality open-source projects in target programming languages. 
As a result, \texttt{TreeNose} achieved a high level of accuracy with 0.94 F1 score in detecting selected code smells. As a comparison, the combination of other tools achieved 0.48 F1 score.
We concluded \texttt{TreeNose} is an effective tool for detecting code smells across programming language systems.
We also analyzed the distribution and prevalence of code smells in the programming language systems with \texttt{TreeNose}. As results of the analysis, we found that
1. Complex Conditional (CC) is the most common code smell across programming languages with 42\% average proportion.
2. Programming languages have strong tendencies in some code smells with at least 1 time worse performance than others.
3. systems written in multi-language have weaker tendencies in code smells compared to the single language systems with zero negative values less than - 1.0.

In the future, we plan to extend \texttt{TreeNose} to detect more code smells and evaluate it with more programming language systems. As for annotation,
we plan to conduct studies with more participants and subjects to increase the reliability of the results.
We also wish to implement \texttt{TreeNose} in a real-world software development environment to see how it can help developers maintain the quality of their codebase.
