{\bf Definitions}. Bearing in mind both the top 15 most common code smells
reported by developers~\cite{developersCare} and those smells commonly detected
by existing tools for Java, JavaScript, and Python, we designed
\texttt{TreeNose} to detect these code smells:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	%
    \item \textbf{Complex Conditional (CC)}~\cite{Fowler_Beck}: occurs when
        a conditional clause contains too many conditions, such as nested {\tt
        if-else} statements, and long {\tt switch-case} statements.
	      %
    \item \textbf{Long Class (LC)}~\cite{Fowler_Beck}: evident when a class
        defines too many (or too lengthy of) properties and/or behaviors.
	      %
    \item \textbf{Long Method (LM)}~\cite{Fowler_Beck}: a method has too
        many lines.
	      %
    \item \textbf{Long Message Chain (LMC)}~\cite{Fowler_Beck}: evident when
        there is a long chain of method calls and/or attribute references.
	      %
    \item \textbf{Long Parameter List (LPL)}~\cite{Fowler_Beck}: occurs when
        a method has too many input parameters.
	      %
\end{itemize}

% Describe each of the steps that TreeNose performs

{\bf Detection Technique}. Focused on the aforementioned code smells,
\texttt{TreeNose} uses Treesitter parsers and an AST-based approach to detect
code smells, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} and described in the
following list of smell detection steps:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	%
    \item \textbf{Step 1: Extract Source Code}: Extract source code written in
        the specified programming language, fetching every target files unless
        it or its containing path is in the ignore list.
	      %
    \item \textbf{Step 2: Parse Source Code to AST}: Using Treesitter and its
        bindings for 18 languages, \texttt{TreeNose} parses the program's source
        code into an AST~\cite{treeSitter}. Adopting Treesitter decouples the
        parsing from the programming language's grammar, making it possible to
        parse multiple-language projects and various projects implemented in
        different languages.
	      %
    \item \textbf{Step 3: Analyze AST to Detect Code Smells}: \texttt{TreeNose}
        analyzes AST to detect code smells. Before the analysis, our developers
        categorize the language-specific Treesitter AST nodes like method and
        function across programming languages into language-independent groups.
        This categorization enables \texttt{TreeNose} to execute the same
        detection process for nodes in the same group across multiple
        programming languages. During the analysis, \texttt{TreeNose} queries
        AST and searches for the associated components in AST. When locating the
        components, \texttt{TreeNose} calculates the metrics against the
        thresholds. Table~\ref{tab:metrics-and-thresholds} shows the detection
        metrics with default thresholds for each code smell. Finally,
        \texttt{TreeNose} generates reports with the list of code smells
        detected in the project.
