    % Depending on the template, some breathing space might need to
    % be added (use \smallskip \medskip etc.) here
    %
    % Or, to save space, you might want to remove space
    % (use a negative \vspace, e.g. \vspace{-1em})

        % The label should appear _inside_ the caption to ensure
        % Latex numbers it correctly. This is a common gotcha!
        %
        % All figure labels should start with "fig:"
        % So that the figure file can be found easily, the rest of the
        % figure label should be the same as the filename, as it is
